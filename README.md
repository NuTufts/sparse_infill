# Infill: Track reconstruction for unresponsive wires in LArTPC images

This repository contains the code to train and deploy a convolutional neural network
that attempts to make predictions for track trajectories through unresponsive wires in LArTPC images.

Poster presentation explaining network and some measures of performance is [here](https://stanford.zoom.us/rec/play/7sJ8JeGrqTs3SNXDtwSDBvN9W469eqms2iQa-aUNzEfjVCELYQfyYboWYLHdC-W3EgMoBqB6gpwogjcr).
